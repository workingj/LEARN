# Design

## 60-30-10 Rule

It is not a strict requirement and can be adjusted to suit individual preferences and design goals. 
You can achieve a well-balanced color scheme that ensures visual interest and coherence in your design
 
- **Your primary colour – a neutral colour,**
  - This is the dominant colour of the design. It forms the foundation of the colour scheme and covers the majority of the design (60%). The primary colour is typically a neutral colour and is often used as the background of the design. Colours like white, blue, beige, and so on can be used as primary colours.
- **Your secondary colour – a colour that supports the primary colour**
  - This colour supports the dominant colour and adds more visual interest to the design. It covers about 30% of the design. The secondary colour can be used for typography, icons, and subheadings/subtitles in a design. Colours like teal, black, dark blue, and others can be used as secondary colours.
- **Your accent colour – a colour that pops!**
  - This colour usually covers about 10% of the design. It helps highlights specific sections of the design like buttons, call-to-action elements, or any element that needs emphasis in a design. Accent colours are usually colours that have high contrast. Colours like yellow, orange, light green, and others make good accent colours.
