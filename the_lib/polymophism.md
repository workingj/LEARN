### Polymorphism

- enable a child type to be used in the same places as the parent type
- which means that you can substitute multiple objects for each other at runtime if they share certain characteristics.

- Rust instead uses generics to abstract over different possible types and trait bounds to impose constraints on what those types must provide. This is sometimes called bounded parametric polymorphism.
